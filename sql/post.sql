It need not be capable of holding all possible invalid addresses.  sepc is a WARL register that must be able to hold all valid virtual addresses. It need not be capable of holding all possible invalid addresses.  If mtval is not read-only zero, it is a WARL register that must be able to hold all valid virtual addresses and the value zero.

The mtvec statement above is ambiguous and doesn''t match the stvec statement, I don''t know any they would be different.  The other registers: mepc, sepc, mtval, stval are specified consistently.
