      <h2>Two Deadlines</h2>
      <div class="mx-5">
        <p>
          CSTG '26 offers authors the choice of two submission deadlines. Any
          paper submitted to one of these deadlines and accepted during the
          subsequent reviewing period will be presented at the conference and
          will appear as part of the proceedings. In the meantime, authors are
          permitted to advertise their papers as accepted by CSTG, for example,
          listing them on CVs. Papers rejected from one of these deadlines
          <strong>cannot</strong> be submitted to the immediate next
          deadline.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Submission Requirements</h2>
      <div class="mx-5">
        <p>
          All submissions to the Computer Science and Technology Conference
          undergo a rigorous double-blind peer review process. Authors are
          therefore required to anonymize their submissions and remove any
          identifying information, such as author names and affiliations, from
          the manuscript and metadata to ensure a fair and unbiased review.
          Submissions should not exceed 14 pages in length, including all
          figures, tables, and references. Papers must be formatted according to
          the conference template, which is available on the conference website.
          Submissions that do not adhere to these guidelines will be rejected
          <strong>without</strong> review.
